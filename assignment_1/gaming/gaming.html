                Currently my favourite game is Destiny 2, and it also my most played game.<br>
                The genre of Destiny 2 is a MMO(mass multiplayer online), looter shooter.<br>
                the genre of this game is why I enjoy it so much, for it being a MMO<br>
                I get to compete or work together with other players to complete missions and such.<br>
                the looter shooter genre in general gets it's player base addicted to the game.<br>
                this is because the players will always try to get better gear and upgrade<br>
                their character as much as they possibly can.
